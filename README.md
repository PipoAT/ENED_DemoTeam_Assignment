# Team Station Assignment Application

This web application allows the dynamic assignment of teams to stations, managing a queue for teams waiting for available stations, and providing real-time updates for both team assignments and the queue.

## Features
- **Assign Teams to Stations**: Teams can be assigned to the highest available active station.
- **Queue Management**: Teams can be added to the queue when no stations are available.
- **Auto-remove**: Teams are automatically removed from stations after 5 minutes unless manually removed.
- **Real-time Updates**: The current team assignments and queue are updated in real-time every 5 seconds without requiring a page refresh.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- Additional Python libraries (`threading`, `time`)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/team-station-assignment.git
cd team-station-assignment
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Application
To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

### Step 4: Access the Pages
- **Main page** (`/`): The home page where you can assign teams to stations and manage station statuses.
- **Assignments page** (`/assignments`): A separate page displaying the current station assignments and team queue. This page updates in real-time every 5 seconds.

### Real-time Updates
The `assignments` page uses **AJAX polling** to fetch the latest team assignments and queue every 5 seconds without requiring a page refresh. This ensures that all users see the most up-to-date data without needing to reload the page manually.
