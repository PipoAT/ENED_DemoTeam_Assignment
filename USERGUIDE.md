# User Guide for Team Station Assignment Application

Welcome to the Team Station Assignment Application! This guide will walk you through the basic features and how to use the application to manage team assignments and station status.

## Overview
The application allows you to:
- Open or close stations
- Assign teams to active stations
- View the current team assignments
- Manage the team queue for unassigned teams

## Getting Started
1. **Access the App**: Navigate to the main page of the application in your web browser.

2. **Homepage**: On the homepage, you’ll see two main sections:
   - **Team Assignment**: Assign teams to available stations.
   - **Station Status**: Toggle the active status of stations.

## Features

### 1. **Toggle Station Active/Inactive Status**
To toggle a station's active status (open or close the station):
1. In the "Station Status" section, find the station you wish to modify.
2. Click on the station button to toggle the active status.
   - If a station is **inactive**, clicking it will make it **active**.
   - If a station is **active**, clicking it will make it **inactive**, and any team assigned to that station will be removed automatically.

### 2. **Assigning Teams**
To assign a team to a station:
1. Enter the **team name** in the input field under "Team Assignment."
2. Click on the **"Assign Team"** button.
3. The team will automatically be assigned to the highest available station. If no station is available, the team will be added to the queue.
4. The system will automatically remove the team from the station after 5 minutes, or you can manually remove them using the remove option.

### 3. **Removing Teams**
To remove a team from a station:
1. Under "Current Assignments," locate the team you want to remove.
2. Click the **"Remove"** button next to the team name.
3. The team will be removed from the station, and the next team in the queue will be assigned if a station is available.
   
### 4. **View Current Assignments**
On the homepage, you’ll see a list of all stations with their current assignments:
- Active stations with assigned teams will display the team name.
- Stations that are inactive or unassigned will be empty.
- Teams in the queue will be visible under the "Queue" section.

### 5. **Queue Management**
If all stations are full, teams will be placed in the queue. When a station becomes available (either when it becomes active or when a team is removed), the next team in the queue will be assigned to the station automatically.

## Summary of Buttons and Actions

- **Assign Team**: Assign a team to the highest available active station.
- **Remove Team**: Remove a team from a station. If there are teams waiting in the queue, the next team will be assigned automatically to the freed station.
- **Toggle Station Active/Inactive**: Open or close a station. If a station is closed, the teams assigned to it are removed, and no teams can be assigned to it.
- **Current Assignments**: View the status of all stations and teams, including teams in the queue.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Teams not appearing in queue**: If teams are not showing up in the queue after being added, ensure that all stations are occupied, and check for any active station status toggles.
- **Team not assigned after a station is activated**: The system will automatically assign the next team in the queue when a station becomes active. If this does not happen, try refreshing the page.

## Conclusion
This application simplifies the process of assigning teams to stations and managing station availability in real-time. You can toggle stations, view assignments, and ensure that all teams are either actively assigned or queued for the next available station.
